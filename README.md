# shkula's portfolio site
hi! welcome to my personal site. you'll find some important links & some info about me. this is a simple static site written w html & css, as well as a tiny bit of js.

if you're interested, [here's](https://www.figma.com/file/l93JFEbIoaqoyqCo7kmPIC/swardak.github.io?node-id=0%3A1) my original figma design for the site. it hasn't been updated in a while, but it might give you a better idea of where i started with the design process.

thanks for reading!
