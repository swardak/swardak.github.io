                i've had the opportunity to learn a ton about software development both at school & at my internships.
                most of my experience is in web dev, where i've had the opportunity to intern as a frontend dev and work
                with angular, html, css & scss, javascript and typescript. at school, my favourite classes have so far
                been analysis & design of user interfaces, design of secure computer systems & intro to data communications
                & networking. i can't wait to learn more about graphics & picture processing, as well as ai, two courses i'm
                looking forward to taking in my next school semester.

                in my free time, i enjoy biking on the trans-canada trail, crocheting little plushies to give to my 
                friends (my most recent project being a frog plushie), dabbling in landscape photography, doing aerial
                yoga at my local gym (pre-covid of course), playing rugby & field hockey, messing around with digital
                drawing, tending to my numerous plants & learning about architecture.

                as i’ve learned more & more about the tech industry through my internships & extracurriculars, i’ve
                discovered a passion for a few different areas of the field. these include product management, ui/ux design, data
                science, and the intersection of tech & healthcare. i’ve also had the chance to create multiple workshops
                encouraging young people to explore the world of tech with the outreach team of an organization called Project Tech
                Conferences (which you can check out <a href="https://projecttechconferences.com/outreach/" target="_blank"
