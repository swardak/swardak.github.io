                    i've had the opportunity to learn a ton about software development both at school & at my internships.
                    most of my experience is in web dev, where i've had the opportunity to intern as a frontend dev and work 
                    with angular, html, css & scss, javascript and typescript. at school, my favourite
                    classes have so far been analysis & design of user interfaces, design of secure computer systems, intro 
                    to software engineering & intro to data communications & networking. i can't wait to learn more about
                    graphics & picture processing, as well as ai, two courses i'm looking forward to taking next year.

                    in my free time, i enjoy biking on the trans-canada trail (currently training to complete a 50 km ride 
                    this summer!), crocheting little plushies to give to my friends (my most recent project being a frog 
                    plushie), dabbling in landscape photography, doing aerial yoga at my local gym (pre-covid of course), 
                    playing rugby, tending to my numerous plants & learning about architecture.

                    as i’ve learned more & more about the tech industry through my internships & extracurriculars, i’ve discovered
                    a passion for a few different areas of the field. these include product management, ui/ux design, data science,
                    and the intersection of tech & healthcare. i’ve also had the chance to create multiple workshops encouraging young
                     people to explore the world of tech with the outreach team of an organization called Project Tech Conferences 
                     (which you can check out <a href="https://projecttechconferences.com/outreach/" target="_blank">here</a>!)
